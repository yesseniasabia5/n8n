- [Bot Skyner](#-bot-skyner) — WhatsApp AI assistant with voice transcription and LLM agent

---

## 🔵 Bot Skyner

### Why I built this

I needed a WhatsApp-native AI assistant that could handle both text and voice messages, route them through an LLM agent with memory, and connect to business tools like Airtable and Gmail — all without a custom backend. Built entirely on n8n using a custom MCP client/server pattern for real-time communication.

### What it does

- Receives text and voice messages from WhatsApp
- Downloads audio and transcribes it via **AssemblyAI**
- Processes the transcript through an **LLM agent (OpenRouter)** with persistent memory via n8n LangChain nodes
- Connects to **Airtable** for data lookups and **Gmail** for notifications
- Sends responses back via WhatsApp API
- Uses a custom **MCP (client/server) over SSE** for real-time inter-workflow communication
